# AI Content Generator SaaS
- ***Founder, CEO, Author***: **`Akash Halder`**
  
This repository contains the codebase for the AI Content Generator SaaS platform. This application leverages modern web technologies to provide a robust and scalable solution for generating various forms of content using artificial intelligence.

## Project Structure

The project follows a well-organized structure to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clear separation of concerns. Below is an overview of the main directories and files:

## Prerequisites

To set up and run this project in a development environment locally on your System(PC), you will need to have **Docker** installed on your system. Docker is essential for utilizing the Dev Container setup, which provides a consistent and isolated development environment.

* **Docker Desktop:**
  * [ ] Download Docker Desktop & set-up for your OS form here: [Install from here](https://www.docker.com/)
  
    <img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/devcontainers/containers/remote-dev-status-bar.png" alt="Remote window">

  * [ ] Click the angular braces to open a remote window from the drop-down by selecting `reopen in container`. After implementing your feature push it in your repo and then send a Pull Request (PR) and `close the remote connection`
  
## Project Configuration

Before starting the development server, you need to configure the project's environment variables.

0. [ ] **Clone the repo**: Clone this repo in your PC:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Nil369/ai-content-generator-saas.git
    ```

1.  [ ] **Create `.env.local`:**
    Duplicate the `env-sample` file and rename it to `.env.local`. This file will contain your local environment-specific variables.

    ```bash
    cp env-sample .env.local
    ```

2.  [ ] **Populate `.env.local`:**
    Open `.env.local` and fill in the necessary values for your development setup. This typically includes API keys, database connection strings, and other sensitive information. Refer to the comments within `env-sample` for guidance on each variable and if you add any library or use **other environment variables on your side just add it also in the env-sample**, **`not the API key (Only the variable name for other developers)`**

    Example (`.env.local`):
    ```shell
    # Example environment variables
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
    # MongoDB
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
    # Clerk Auth Secret
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
    ```

## Starting the Development Server

This project is configured to use **VS Code Dev Containers**, which provides a ready-to-use development environment with all dependencies pre-installed.

1.  [ ] **Open in Dev Container:**
    * Ensure Docker is running on your machine.
    * Open the project folder in VS Code.
    * VS Code should prompt you to "Reopen in Container" (if you have the Dev Containers extension installed). Click this prompt.
    * If you don't see the prompt, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and search for "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container".

    The first time you open the project in a Dev Container, it will build the Docker image and set up the environment. This might take a few minutes (and yeah if you need to keep on the docker desktop for the whole time up, if you close it you need to restart again the system to again run the docker engine).

2.  [ ] **Automatic Dependency Installation:**
    The `postCreateCommand` in `.devcontainer.json` is configured to automatically install Bun (if not present) and then run `bun install` to set up all project dependencies. You do not need to run `bun install` manually after the container is created.

3.  [ ] **Start the Development Server:**
    Once the Dev Container is fully set up and the terminal is ready, you can start the Next.js development server. *If you are facing issue delete the node_modules folder and .next folder and manually run commands* `bun install` and `bun run dev`

    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

    This command will start the Next.js development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`. You can then access the application in your web browser.
